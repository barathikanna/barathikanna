## My Projects & Achievements
### Projects
- **Churn360-Ecommounication: A Multimodal Explainable AI Framework for E-commerce Customer Churn Prediction**
	- Designed an AI solution to predict which customers are likely to leave by analysing purchase behaviour and review text on a realistic, causally modelled dataset.
	- Used Logistic Regression and XGBoost to uncover the main reasons behind customer attrition.
	- Applied DiCE counterfactuals, SHAP, and LIME to make insights clear and actionable for non-technical teams.
	- Extended beyond prediction to analyse counterfactual scenarios (e.g., impact of offering discounts) for targeted retention strategies.
	- Built an interactive Streamlit dashboard so marketing teams can see churn risk, key drivers, and recommended actions at a glance.

- **Research Assistant: Scientific Journal Parser**
	- Developed an AI-powered parser using PyPDF, CSVLoader, and LangChain to process and analyse research PDFs.
	- Extracted text, tables, charts, and images into structured ChromaDB storage for retrieval.
	- Implemented an RAG(Nomic Embedding) + LLM (llama3) chatbot to answer complex, multi-document research queries, including visual data interpretation.
	- Built a Streamlit frontend supporting multi-project article organisation, conversational querying, and analytics.

### Professional Highlights
- **Automation Wizardry:** Automated OS patching for 296 servers using Ansible, improving efficiency and saving countless hours of manual work.
- **Data Pipeline Guru:** Migrated tenants to Confluent Kafka, ensuring business continuity and cost savings while managing data ingestion with Logstash and indexing with Elasticsearch.
- **Scalable Solutions:** Managed production and non-production databases on Oracle and AWS platforms, with a keen focus on scalability, security, and performance.
- **Innovative Visualizations:** Developed a Python script for real-time Jira stats visualization, significantly enhancing reporting efficiency.
